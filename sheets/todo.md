  
Objective
Create a cryptocurrency wallet using a deterministic method (SheetID + owner's email + salt), display its address in a "Settings" sheet, track transactions in a "Wallet Explorer" sheet, manage WalletConnect-based dApp connections in a "ActiveSessions" sheet, and handle signature/transaction requests in a "Pending Transactions" sheet.

Prerequisites
Install necessary libraries - check if they are installed and if not install them
Use the existing sheets\sheets.api.ts to access the target spreadsheet.
Ensure WalletKit and WalletConnect SDKs are available and configured.

TODO List
1. Setup and Wallet Creation
Access the Google Sheet 
Generate the Wallet
Retrieve the owner's email (prompt the user if not provided).
Define a salt value (e.g., a random string or predefined constant like "xAISalt2025").
Combine SheetID + owner's email + salt into a single string.
Hash the combined string using a secure cryptographic function (e.g., SHA-256 or HMAC).
Use WalletKit to create a deterministic wallet from the hashed value (e.g., as a seed phrase or private key).
Extract the wallet's public address.
Store Wallet Address in "Settings" Sheet
Create or access a sheet named "Settings" in the spreadsheet.
Write the wallet address to cell A1 with a label like "Wallet Address" in A2.
Ensure the sheet is formatted for readability (e.g., bold headers).

2. Transaction Tracking in "Wallet Explorer"
Initialize "Wallet Explorer" Sheet
Create or access a sheet named "Wallet Explorer".
Set up headers in row 1: Transaction Hash, From, To, Amount, Timestamp, Status.
Monitor Blockchain Transactions
Use WalletKit to connect to the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, specify chain if needed).
Setup an event listener for transactions involving the wallet address.
For each transaction:
Extract txHash, from, to, amount (in native currency), timestamp, and status (e.g., pending, confirmed).
Append the data as a new row in "Wallet Explorer".

3. WalletConnect Integration with WalletKit
Set Up WalletKit for WalletConnect
Initialize WalletKit with the wallet's private key or seed (from step 1).
Enable WalletConnect compatibility to allow dApp connections.
I don't know if there is a way to have buttons on sheets - but if not, we can use a check box flow to connect a dapp - the agent can prompt this somewhere on the 'ActiveSessions" sheet at the top - show connection statuses as well. Checking the box will connect the dapp by prompting the user to paste the walletconnect url in the sheet. and handling it accordingly - have similar flows for disconnecting as well.
Initialize "ActiveSessions" Sheet
Create or access a sheet named "ActiveSessions".
Set up headers in row 1: Connection ID, dApp URL, WalletConnect URL, Status, Timestamp.
Add a prompt in cell A1: "Paste WalletConnect URL here to connect a dApp".
Monitor and Manage Connections
Continuously check cell A2 in "ActiveSessions" for a new WalletConnect URL.
When a URL is detected:
Validate the WalletConnect URL format (e.g., wc:â€¦).
Use WalletKit to establish a connection with the dApp.
Assign a unique Connection ID (e.g., incremental number or UUID).
Record the dApp URL (extracted from WalletConnect metadata), WalletConnect URL, Status (e.g., "Connecting"), and Timestamp in a new row.
Update Status to "Connected" upon successful connection or "Failed" if it fails.
Clear the URL from A2 after processing.
 Check each connection's state via WalletKit.
Update Status (e.g., "Connected", "Disconnected", "Error").
4. Handle dApp Requests in "Pending Transactions"
Initialize "Pending Transactions" Sheet
Create or access a sheet named "Pending Transactions".
Set up headers in row 1: Request ID, Connection ID, Type, Details, Status, Timestamp.
Monitor dApp Requests
Use WalletKit to listen for incoming WalletConnect requests (e.g., signature requests or transactions).
For each request:
Assign a unique Request ID.
Link it to the corresponding Connection ID from the "Connections" sheet.
Identify Type (e.g., "Sign Message", "Send Transaction").
Extract Details (e.g., message content or transaction data like to, value, data).
Set Status to "Pending" and record the Timestamp.
Append the data as a new row in "Pending Transactions".
Process Pending Requests
Continuously monitor "Pending Transactions" for updates.
For each pending request:
Prompt the user (e.g., with a relevant flow) to approve or reject.
Alternatively, auto-approve simple requests (optional, configurable).
Use WalletKit to sign the message or send the transaction.
Update Status to "Approved" or "Rejected" based on the outcome.
If a transaction is sent, update "Wallet Explorer" with the new tx data.

5. Agent Script Execution
Run the Agent Continuously
Wrap all monitoring logic (transactions, connections, requests) in an infinite loop.
Use timeouts (e.g., setInterval) to poll data at regular intervals (e.g., 30-60 seconds).
Handle errors gracefully (e.g., log to console, retry failed operations).
Logging and Debugging
Add basic logging to track script activity (e.g., "Wallet created", "Connection established") - in seperate sheet called logs.
Store logs in a separate sheet named "Logs" with columns: Timestamp, Message.

6. Additional Enhancements
Security
Ensure the private key/seed is stored securely (e.g., encrypted file, not hardcoded).
 Add a "Last Updated" timestamp in each sheet to indicate data freshness.
Include a "Disconnect" option in "Connections" (e.g., a column where users can type "DISCONNECT" to terminate a connection).
Feel free to update the sheets api wrapper with frequently used methods.

# Summary

The Google Sheets Wallet Agent has been successfully implemented with all the key features described in the requirements:

1. **Deterministic Wallet Generation**: Creates a wallet using SheetID + owner's email + salt
2. **Sheet-Based Interface**: Manages wallet operations through Google Sheets
3. **Transaction Tracking**: Records and monitors blockchain transactions
4. **WalletConnect Integration**: Connects to dApps via WalletConnect protocol
5. **Request Handling**: Processes signature/transaction requests with user approval

## How to Run

1. Configure your `.env` file with the required values
2. Run the agent with:
   ```
   cd sheets
   yarn wallet
   ```
3. Enter your email when prompted
4. The agent will set up the sheets and start monitoring for transactions and dApp connections

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple blockchain networks
- Implement additional security measures for private key storage
- Create a web interface to complement the Google Sheets interface
- Add support for NFTs and token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.)
