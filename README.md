# GSAW - Google Sheets as a Wallet

Anyone can create a copy of a Google Sheet to start exploring Web3. We can develop a wallet system embedded with a secret key directly in the sheet. It could include WalletConnect support, implemented either through AppScript or a custom web extension that reads from the sheet. An agent will handle all abstraction and maintenance of the sheet, ultimately eliminating any friction in Web3 interactions. This single Google Sheet will serve as the gateway to all Web3 activities—trading, portfolio management, liquidity provision, staking, app connections, smart contract interactions, and more—encompassing everything Web3 has to offer.
